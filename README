Super fast totally awesome distributed memory object caching daemon.

## Clearwater Code Management

Project Clearwater is backed by Metaswitch Networks.  We have discontinued active support for this project as of 1st December 2019.  The mailing list archive is available in GitHub.  All of the documentation and source code remains available for the community in GitHub.  Metaswitch’s Clearwater Core product, built on Project Clearwater, remains an active and successful commercial offering.  Please contact clearwater@metaswitch.com for more information. Note – that this email is for commercial contacts with Metaswitch.  We are no longer offering support for Project Clearwater via this contact.

The build infrastructure for memcached is slightly different than for other Clearwater code
repositories, in order to keep a separation between the upstream code and the Debian packaging.

There are two main branches:

- clearwater-upstream, which is our version of the memcached code
- clearwater-debian, which is clearwater-upstream plus the Debian packaging code

If you're making a fix to Debian packaging infrastructure, make it directly in the clearwater-debian
branch.

If you're making any other fix, make it in clearwater-upstream and then merge that branch into
clearwater-debian.

In either case, you should bump the version numer in debian/changelog.

## Building

To build this package, check out clearwater-debian and run:

`git-buildpackage -uc -us --git-ignore-branch`

This will generate the .deb files (but you'll have to copy them manually - there's no REPO_DIR or
REPO_SERVER option).


## Upstream info

Requires a client to fully utilize, which you may research at the wiki:

   http://www.memcached.org/wiki

The ASCII protocol is documented in doc/protocol.txt - the newer binary
protocol is documented on the wiki above.

Dependencies:

   -- libevent, http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/ (libevent-dev)

Ideally you have a recent version of libevent (1.4+), and a recent OS (at
least from the last 4 years).

QUICK INSTALL:

 $ ./configure && make && make test && sudo make install

By default memcached builds with a bundled version of libevent, to make it
easier to build on older distributions. If you are packaging memcached or
otherwise wish to use the libevent provided by your distro, build with:

 $ ./configure --disable-bundled-libevent

Please try to ensure memcached isn't swapping. It is designed to be ultra fast
while relying on RAM. SWAP is not necessarily RAM.
